# Project: Service Management System

## Project Description

This project involves creating a conceptual schema for a service management system for an auto repair shop. The objective is to design a model that manages various aspects of service orders, from vehicle intake through service completion.

The conceptual schema has been developed using the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) approach, which provides a visual representation of the system's entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.

## Objective

To develop a conceptual schema that captures the essential elements of an auto repair shop's service management system. This includes:

- Managing customers and their vehicles.
- Handling service orders and their associated details.
- Organizing mechanics, teams, and the services they perform.
- Tracking parts used and labor costs.

## ER Diagram

For a visual representation of the conceptual schema, please refer to the ER diagram included in the `docs/` folder. This diagram illustrates the structure of the system and how different components interact.

## Usage Instructions

- **View ER Diagram**: Open the `er_diagram.png` or `er_diagram.pdf` file located in the `docs/` folder to view the conceptual model.

## Additional Context

If there are any assumptions or interpretations beyond the provided narrative, these have been noted in the project documentation. For further details, please refer to the `README.md` and the ER diagram.
